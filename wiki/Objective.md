## objective of the project:
It's our goal to create a program that can be used to determine the weather based on a picture of the sky.

## implementation
We have written an algorithm that analyzes the Color values of an image to determine the displayed weather. It will classify the weather as ‘clear‘, ‘rainy‘ or ‘overcast‘. We are also using a weather API to check if this classification is correct. Should the classification be wrong, we have implemented a further algorithm that carries out a small correction of the values ​​in order to achieve greater accuracy in the future.

## time prioritization
Implementation goal:
* To be able to determine the weather on a picture with the help of a color comparison
* To be able to check this guess against real-world data from an API

Additional objective:
* to add code that will help improve the accuracy of our weather determination algorithm over time
* to add an UI for better User experience
